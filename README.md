#  Quantile sheet estimator with shape constraints
- This quantile sheet estimator has non-crossing properties for different quantiles. It features the local GCV parameter tunning and simulation shows fast convergence.
- Quantile sheet is a global estimator for multiple quantile curves. We use SCOP: shape-constrained P-spline to enforce the non-crossing properties directly in construction.
- Data simulation shows the proposed method and existing competitors can recover the underlying quantiles with comparable mean square error.
